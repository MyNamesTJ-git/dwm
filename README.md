This will be my DWM/DWL configurations when i eventually get to making them

As of now, the plan is to take @tonybanters's dwl setup and modifing it from there as he has configurations that i already desire. I will make edits to how i see fit and theme it to the Nord theme
Some of these are going to be directly taken from others with small simple edits from myself, I will try to credit all using Github, YouTube or Reddit names
